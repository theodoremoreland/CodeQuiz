# CodeQuiz
A timed, browser based coding quiz. Built using vanilla JavaScript. Automated testing with Jest.

### How to play
Once you press the "Start Quiz" button, the timer will count down by one point per second. If you get an answer wrong, 15 points / seconds will be subtracted from the timer. If your score / time goes to 0 or less, the game will immediately end. By the end of the game, whatever time is left on the timer is your final score.
